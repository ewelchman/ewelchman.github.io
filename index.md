* Scrape tables from PFR
A scraper to grab tables from pro-football-reference.com.

* Cleaning play-by-play data
Take play-by-play data scraped from PFR and parse the play details to determine play type and results.

* [**Modeling win-percent**](./projects/modeling_winpct.ipynb).
Given the game state, determine how likely one team is to go on to win the game. I try using logistic regression, a small neural net, and random forest algorithms as models and evaluate the performance of each.

* Scrape drive-level data from ESPN
I develop a scraper specific to ESPN's web interface to grab play-by-play data.

* Model NFL games with Monte Carlo.
Simulate football games by drawing from a pool of a team's past drives. I score each past drive by similarity to the current game state.

# Other data projects

* [**Investigating dropped packets**](./projects/dropped_packets.html). 
A fairly straightforward data exploration in order to investigate where some data packets were being dropped in the Wake Forest network.

* [**Scrabbledice**](./projects/scrabbledice.ipynb).
Designing a Boggle-like set of dice for a board game: I implement a genetic-adjacent algorithm to find the best way to arrange letters on the dice, then for a sanity check I look at the results that score best.
