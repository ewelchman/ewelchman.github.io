    "# Scrape play-by-play data from ESPN\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is a bit messy, but the idea is pretty simple. Profootballreference.com's play-by-play tables are one of the best resources out there, but they don't say which team has the ball. That's easy to figure out with context, but not for an algorithm that doesn't know what players are on what team. ESPN's webpages for individual game play-by-play makes it easier to tell which team has the ball for a given drive because they have little team logos next to each drive saying which team has the ball. So I wrote a scraper to get that information from ESPN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraper works like this:\n",
    "* Use the requests library to get an html version of the webpage.\n",
    "* Make a soup object from the source html.\n",
    "* Use a customized function to grab a particular table from the soup object.\n",
    "* In that table, pull out individual drives, which each load an image. The name of the image tells us which team has the ball.\n",
    "* Within each drives, grab individual plays. I make a dictionary for each column that I then put together to make a single pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code written here first checks a different page to compile a list of urls for individual games. I then use the scraper to loop through webpages for individual games.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process the raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "Making sense of the raw data is crucial. I do a few things to make the data useful.\n",
    "* Parse down, distance, and field position.\n",
    "* Parse quarter and time remaining.\n",
    "* Make columns for score difference and total score.\n",
    "* Make columns for whether home team has possession and wins.\n",
    "* Parse play detail to determine whether an individual play is a run, pass, scramble, punt, field goal, whether a pass is complete, and how many yards were gained on the play.\n",
    "* Determine whether an offensive play is \"successful\"."
